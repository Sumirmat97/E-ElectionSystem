# E-Election System #

### What is this repository for? ###

* This contains the E-Election System as made by me in class 12 along with a friend as graded project.
* Version 1

### About Project ###
* The project opens with a graphical load page.
* Initially the users can enroll themselves as voters. The data is stored in files.
* Voters can see enrolled candidates and their manifestos.
* Users can also register as candidates and submit their manifestos. This is stored in a different file.
* The election officer (the person who has the admin password) has some admin rights:
   * Removing candidates and voters from the candidate and voter lists.
   * Commencing elections. After this no one can register. The users can then cast their votes. There is also an option of none of the above.
   * Stop the voting and start the counting of votes.
   * Display results of the election. The results are displayed using a graphical pie-chart.
   * Exit the application.
